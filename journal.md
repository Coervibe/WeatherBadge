title: "WeatherBadge"
author: "Ankit Tripathi"
description: "WeatherBadge is a compact, low-power wearable badge that senses and displays real-time temperature using a digital sensor and shows it on a stylish OLED screen. Built using the lightweight ATtiny85 microcontroller, this device is powered by a coin cell battery and designed to be worn like a name badge or keychain.The display scrolls your name or custom message along with the current ambient temperature in Celsius. Itâ€™s simple, elegant, and fun â€” a perfect conversation starter and beginner-friendly embedded hardware project."

### ðŸ“… Date: june 21, 2025  
**Time Spent:** 1 hour  
**What I Did:**  
- Brainstormed ideas for a wearable electronics project.  
- Finalized the concept of a smart badge that displays temperature and name.  
- Decided to use ATtiny85 for minimal power usage and learning experience.

### ðŸ“… Date: june 18, 2025  
**Time Spent:** 5 hours  
**What I Did:**
- take a lot of time  beacause first learn how to make it.
- Created initial schematic in EasyEDA using ATtiny85, DHT11, OLED display, and coin cell.  
- Added pull-up resistor and capacitor for sensor stability.  
- Verified pinout for ATtiny85 with I2C OLED.

**Time Spent:** 3 hours  
**What I Did:**  
- Designed a 3D case in Tinkercad to house the badge.  
- Added space for OLED, sensor holes, and battery holder.  
- Exported and sliced STL for 3D printing.
