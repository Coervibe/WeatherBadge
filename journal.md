description: "WeatherBadge is a compact, low-power wearable badge that senses and displays real-time temperature using a digital sensor and shows it on a stylish OLED screen. Built using the lightweight ATtiny85 microcontroller, this device is powered by a coin cell battery and designed to be worn like a name badge or keychain.The display scrolls your name or custom message along with the current ambient temperature in Celsius. Itâ€™s simple, elegant, and fun â€” a perfect conversation starter and beginner-friendly embedded hardware project."
