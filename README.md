# WeatherBadge

**WeatherBadge** is a compact, low-power wearable badge that senses and displays real-time temperature using a digital sensor and shows it on a stylish **OLED screen**. Built using the lightweight **ATtiny85 microcontroller,** this device is powered by a coin cell battery and designed to be worn like a name badge or keychain.

The display scrolls your name or custom message along with the current ambient temperature in Celsius. It’s simple, elegant, and fun — a perfect conversation starter and beginner-friendly embedded hardware project.

## Why I Made This Project:

I wanted to build something cool, small, and functional that I could wear — something that uses real sensors, displays data visually, and can be powered by a single coin cell. Inspired by smart badges and DIY electronics, I decided to create this WeatherBadge for Hack Club’s Highway, combining design, electronics, and creativity.


## Features:

-Displays live temperature using a DHT11 sensor

-0.96” OLED screen (SSD1306 I2C)

-Powered by CR2032 coin cell

-Wearable form factor (badge/keychain)

-Microcontroller: ATtiny85 (DIP-8)

- Custom PCB and 3D printed case
